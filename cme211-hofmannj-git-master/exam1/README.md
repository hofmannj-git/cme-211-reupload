I do not have enough time remaining to write as complete a README as I'd like.

I use a list min() method to find the lowest score, and then to remove it I also use list
methods.  I chose a procedural approach for modularity, so I could break down the
process into clear functions. If I had more time, I would double check the math part of the
calculation to ensure that the averaging is correct, as it looks like the weighting might not
be correct to have the total be max 1.0.

I wish I also had time to more rigorously validate my test cases with changing the weights.

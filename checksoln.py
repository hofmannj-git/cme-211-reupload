# Store the maze in an appropriate NumPy array

# Read the solution and make sure the maze was properly entered on
    # the first row, each position change is valid (i.e. you move one
    # position at a time, donâ€™t go through a wall, and stay within
    # the bounds of the maze), and that you reach the exit of the
    # maze on the last row
